TreeBox is the barebones Tree display for tree.js, released for the people who wished to make their own app using my simple framework and didnt need the extras that I put so much time into. Because of this images have to be manually entered and coded and any other features aswell. Personally tho I would just use the streamline Tree.js.

I have noticed that TreeJS is decent size right now and people who have just launched the game cant run it, so this is TreeJS but like stripped down of a lot of things, basically TreeBoxBarebones but its decent looking and still has Shift + Click to switch servers. No popups/stats tho.
