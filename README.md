## [TreeBoxBarebones.js](/TreeBoxBarebones.js)  
TreeBox is the barebones Tree display for tree.js, released for the people who wished to make their own app using my simple framework and didnt need the extras that I put so much time into. Because of this images have to be manually entered and coded and any other features aswell. Personally tho I would just use the streamline Tree.js.
